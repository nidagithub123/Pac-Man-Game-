# Pac-Man-Game-
Game
This project is a modern adaptation of the classic Pac-Man game, created as part of my Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) coursework using Visual Studio, Windows Forms, and C#. The game features custom-designed assets, including Pac-Man, ghosts, and coins, all created using Adobe Illustrator. The game's theme is set against a sleek black background. Pac-Man can be controlled in four directions (up, down, left, right), and the objective is to collect all the coins while avoiding walls and ghosts. The game includes four walls and three moving ghosts. If Pac-Man eats all the coins, a "You Win" screen appears along with the score. However, if Pac-Man touches a ghost or a wall, the game is over, and the score is displayed. The repository also contains a GIF to demonstrate Pac-Man's movement in all four directions. This project demonstrates interactive design and user feedback principles.
